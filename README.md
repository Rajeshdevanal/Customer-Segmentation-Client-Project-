**📊 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering**
**📌 Project Overview**

This project focuses on customer segmentation using Python and K-Means clustering to group customers based on their demographics and purchasing behavior. The objective is to identify meaningful customer segments that help businesses understand customer needs, improve targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer retention, and increase overall sales performance.

**🎯 Objectives**

Analyze customer demographic and transactional data

Segment customers using unsupervised machine learning

Identify optimal clusters using Silhouette Score

Generate actionable business insights for decision-making

**📂 Dataset**

The dataset contains customer-related information such as:

Age, gender, and income

Purchase frequency and spending behavior

Product categories and transaction history

Note: Data preprocessing and cleaning were performed before analysis.

**🔍 Methodology**

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Removing outliers

Feature selection

Feature Scaling

Applied standardization to ensure equal feature contribution

Customer Segmentation

Implemented K-Means clustering

Determined optimal number of clusters using evaluation techniques

Cluster Evaluation

Used Silhouette Score to measure clustering effectiveness

**🧩 Customer Segments Identified**

High-Value Customers: Frequent buyers with high spending

Price-Sensitive Customers: Purchase mainly during discounts

Occasional Buyers: Low purchase frequency and engagement

**📈 Key Insights**

A small segment of customers contributes a large share of revenue

Engagement frequency strongly impacts customer value

Personalized marketing improves conversion and retention

**💡 Business Recommendations**

Introduce loyalty programs for high-value customers

Offer personalized discounts to price-sensitive segments

Re-engage occasional buyers with targeted campaigns

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Techniques: EDA, Feature Scaling, K-Means Clustering, Silhouette Score
